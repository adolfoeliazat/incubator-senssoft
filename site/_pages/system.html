title: The Apache SensSoft System
subtitle: Easy combined deployment with Docker
component: Apache SensSoft

description: Apache SensSoft is a line of products that provides all the components needed for tracking, analyzing and visualizing user event data. Apache UserALE provides comprehensive user event tracking for web pages, but it is specially engineered for toolsâ€“applications users will use in their work. Apache Distill is an analytics framework for handling and analyzing UserALE data. Apache TAP provides you with a customizable array of interactive visual analytic libraries (D3) to extract insights from your usage data, and a single point of access for end users of the SensSoft system. Each component is available on their own through our Apache repositories. However, we have bundled these components into an easy-to-deploy, pre-configured Docker container so that you can begin to collect data as soon as possible.

    <p>
      The Apache SensSoft System includes a complete backend deployment of UserALE, Distill, and Tap.  The different components are connected as seen below and ready to work together out of the box.  UserALE clients will still need to be included in the target applications to push logs into the system.
